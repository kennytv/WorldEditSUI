# WorldEditSUI Plugin by kennytv

# If enabled, the positions for particles will only be calculated once per selection and then cached.
# This essentially entirely removes the higher CPU usage of the calculations, but results in some caching if many/big selections are being made.
#
# Disable this if you run into concurreny errors.

# A list of all particles can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Particle.html
# Just note that newly introduced particles obviously won't work in older versions.
# Shown for the selection you currently have.
#
# If you want to use a particle that requires extra data (REDSTONE, FALLING_DUST, BLOCK_DUST, BLOCK_CRACK, ITEM_CRACK),
# you can read up on how to do that at the bottom of the plugin's Spigot page.
# The same applies to per-particle view-distance, speed, and offsets.

# Can be enabled with the '/wesui toggleclipboard' command.

# This number determines how many ticks should be between every sending of particles.
# Can be set from 5 to 200.
# For reference: 20 Minecraft ticks are equivalent to 1 second -> 10 ticks are 0.5 seconds -> 1 tick is 0.05 seconds.

# Selecting giant areas may result in a high cpu usage or server lag.
# This limits the maximum number of blocks that can be displayed (default is 10 million, ~250*150*250 blocks).
# You could still go even higher if they can only be used by trusted people.
